<h2>3. B-Tree</h2>
<div>
  <p>
    I recently learned about B-Tree and made a basic 3-way B-Tree.
    <br>
    You can add integer variables into B-Tree and delete from it efficiently.
    <br>
    You will learn why it is efficient by inserting thousands or millions of variables and deleting them.
